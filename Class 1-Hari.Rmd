##Keyboard shortcuts
1. Assignment operator is `Alt + -` for Windows and `Option + -` for Mac
2. Create a new code chunk `Ctrl+Alt+I` for Windows and `Command+Option+I` for Mac
3. Run a line `Ctrl + Enter` for Windows and `Command + Enter` for Mac

##Variable Assignment
1. Assign a value to a variable.
```{r}
myFirstVar <- "Hello World!"

myFirstVar <- 
```

2. Reassign a new value to the same variable.
```{r}
myFirstVar <- "R4D"

myFirstVar <- "Hello World"
```


3. Assign a new variable the value of the old variable
```{r}
mySecondVar <- myFirstVar
```

4. What happens when we change the new variable does the old change as well?
```{r}
mySecondVar <- "Not hello"
```



####**Break for Task**
1. Create the folder structure for the class on your computer called "yourfirstnameR4D" with the following subfolders in it - "Assignments", "Classes" and "Data". This will be your folder for the entire course.
2. Create an R notebook change its YAML title to "Class 1 Exercises"
3. Create a level 2 header called "My first exercise"
4. Create your first code chunk (remember to use the shortcuts)  
5. Within it assign any value you would like to a variable. Print this value. Save the file in the "Classes" subfolder
6. Preview the notebook. 
7. Use this notebook to take in class notes, try out things and complete in class tasks.

##Data Structures

###Atomic vectors
1. Create atomic vectors of different types
`c()` is short for combine
```{r}
petNames <- c("Tommy", "Singha", "Chacko")
petAge <- c(4, 5, 14)
male <- c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
```


2. Determine their type using `typeof()`

```{r}
typeof(petNames)
typeof(petAge)
typeof(male)
```

3. Create vectors using `seq()`, `paste()` and the `:` shorthand


```{r}
##Create a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 40
evenSeq <- seq(from = 2, to = 40, by = 2)

##Lets paste a few words together
pasteChars <- paste("Hi!", "welcome", "to", "the course")

hiPets <- paste("Hi", petNames)

```
4. What happens when you combine different data types?
Coercion heirarchy: logical, integer, double, character
```{r}
c("Hi", 1, "one")
```

```{r}
c(1.0, 3.4, 5L)
```

```{r}
c(TRUE, FALSE, "TRUE")
```

```{r}
c(T, F, 1)
```

###Lists
1. Create a list

```{r}
testList <- list(hiPets, petAge, petNames, evenSeq)

testList
```

```{r}
listWithinList <- list(testList, classFirstVar)

listWithinList
```


2. Create a named list and access its names using `names()`

```{r}
namedList <- list(petNames = petNames, petAge = petAge)

namedList
```

###Data Frame
1. Create a data frame
```{r}
pets <- data.frame(petNames, age = petAge, male)

pets
```


2. Find the `ncol()`, `nrow()` and `length()` of the data frame
```{r}
ncol(pets)
nrow(pets)
length(pets)
```

```{r}
is.list(pets)
```


###Missing values
1. What type of a vector is `NA`?
2. What are the other types of NA values?
3. Create a vector with NA values
4. Identify `NA` values in a vector using `is.na()`

###Factors
1. Create a factor variable to represent gender

####**Break for Task**
1. Create and store a character vector (of your choice), a numeric vector (interger/double) and a factor, all of the same length


2. Use `seq()` to generate an atomic vector containing all the odd numbers less than 100

```{r}
oddNums <- seq(from = 1, to = 100, by = 2)
oddNums
```


3. Store all the vectors created in step 1 in a named list
```{r}
taskList <- list(petNames, petAge, male, oddNums, hiPets)

typeof(c(1, FALSE))
c(1.2, FALSE)
```
4. Create a dataframe using all the vectors stored in step 1
```{r}
taskDF <- data.frame(petNames, petAge, male)

taskDF
```

5. Predict the output of the following without running the code in 
    + `c("FALSE", FALSE, T, F, T, T, T)` = "Character", 
    + `c(1.0, FALSE)` = "numeric", 
    + `c(2, TRUE)`  = "numeric"and 
    + `c("two", 2)` = "character"

##Subsetting data structures

###Atomic vectors
1. Subset using positive integers, negative integers, and logical vectors

###Lists
1. Try the same as atomic vectors

###Data frames
1. Filter rows
2. Select columns
3. Select columns using named column ranges
4. Subset columns and rows



###The other two subsetting operators
1. Show the difference between `[]` and `[[]]` or `$`
2. Use `[[]]` to subset atomic vectors, lists and data frames

####**Break for Task**
1. From the sequence of odd numbers created in the previous set of tasks remove all the multiples of 5 (use `seq()`) to create all the multiples of 5 under 100)
2. Remove the last row from the data frame you created previously
3. Select the last 2 columns in the data frame you created
4. Use `[]`, `[[]]` and `$` to select the second item in the list that you created
5. Use `identical()` to check if the two items created through `[[]]` and `$` are identical


##Advanced subsetting

###Operators
1. Arithmetic operations
2. Relational
3. Logical
