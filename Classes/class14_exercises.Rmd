##Task Set 1: Load and compare
1. Load the messy gapminder data using `read_csv()`. If you saved the data inside a data folder that is in the same folder as this notebook the path would be: "data/gapminder_wide.csv".

Note, path characters don't need to be reversed
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
gapdata <- read_csv("../data/gapminder_wide.csv")
```



2. Use `head()` to print out the first 10 rows (you will need to set the n argument within the function to 10 to change it from the default of 6)

```{r}
head(gapdata)
```

```{r}
names(gapdata)
```



3. Compare the output above with the `gapminder` data from the gapminder package.
```{r}
gapminder::gapminder
```

4. What are some issues with the wide version of the data (from the perspective of tidyness)
Issues are that values that should be consolidated in one column are currently spread acrosss multiple columns,
namely, gdp, lifeExp, pop




##Task Set 2: Plan
1. Discuss and list the issues with this data within your group (from the perspective of tidyness)

2. Write down the steps you will take to clean this data up (in terms of `tidyr` functions). So for instance: "I will gather xyz columns, then separate a_b_c...."

##Task Set 3: Clean
1. Load and clean the untidy gapminder data.

```{r}
gapdata %>% 
  mutate(Year = "1952", "1957", "1962", "1967", "1972", "1977", "1982", "1987", "1992", "1997", "2002", "2007")
```



##Task Set 4: Non vectorised conditional
1. Correct the code below so that it runs.
```{r}
animal <- sample(c("Birds", "Fish"), size = 1)

if(animal = "Fish"){
    print("I can swim")
} else {
    print("I can't swim")
}
```
2. Modify the code above to check if an animal is a "Bird" and print whether it can fly or not.

3. Print "yes" if there are `any()` values greater than 4 in the vector x below.
```{r}
x <- c(3, 6, 7, 8, NA)

```
4. Modify the code you wrote for task 3 to check if there are any values greater than 8. This will likely throw an error. See the documentation for `any()` to see how ot address this

##Task Set 5: Vectorized
1. Use an `if_else()` statement to create a character vector that indicates whether a given value in x is missing. It should be marked "missing" if a value is missing and "not missing" otherwise. You can tell if an element in a vector is missing using the function `is.na()`

```{r}
x <- c(3, 6, 7, 8, NA)
```

2. Load the gapminder package

3. Use the `if_else()` in a `mutate()` to add a new column to the gapminder data that indicates whether the year is greater than 2000.

4. Complete the following code to create a new variable called incomeGroup that cuts the `gdpPercap` variable based on the median value of the `gdpPercap` every year. The final variable should have 4 levels - Low income, low middle income, high middle income and high income. I have complete one of the levels for you in the code. Complete the rest.
```{r}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroups = case_when(
        gdpPercap < 0.5 * median(gdpPercap) ~ "Low income",
    )) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~incomeGroups)
```


4. Complete the code below. For every year I would like to mark the `incomeGroup` variable as "Above" if it is above the median `gdpPercap` for that year (global median). The subsequent plot explores the relationship between `incomeGroup` and the `lifeExp`
```{r, fig.width = 9}
library(gapminder); library(ggthemes)
gapminder %>% 
    group_by() %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroup = if_else()) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp, colour = incomeGroup)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Over time life expectancy in high income countries have converged while those in low income countries have diverged", width = 70),
         y = "Life Expectancy",
         colour = "Income Group") +
    theme_tufte() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    )
    
    
```
