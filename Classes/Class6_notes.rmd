title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


### notes

So for ggplot, you have the option to link the aes argument to the ggplot function or the subfunction for the chart type. For latter, loses flexibility
for a second chart.


IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HOSTING FILES. FIRST IS "COPY PATH BUTTON" when you're in the code UI.

Next, here is the root folder for my repo:
https://noosphereintern.github.io/R4D-class/

then for rendering any one file, just add the relative path from here.

NOTE in ggplot, when you need to split up data into multiple lines on the chart, use colour = 'param' or group = 'param'. colour argument
has an implied grouping. the line chart is geom_line

you can superimpose charts on top of each other with new arguments
