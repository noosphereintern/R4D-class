This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 



### notes

So for ggplot, you have the option to link the aes argument to the ggplot function or the subfunction for the chart type. For latter, loses flexibility
for a second chart.


IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HOSTING FILES. FIRST IS "COPY PATH BUTTON" when you're in the code UI.

Next, here is the root folder for my repo:
https://noosphereintern.github.io/R4D-class/

then for rendering any one file, just add the relative path from here.

NOTE in ggplot, when you need to split up data into multiple lines on the chart, use colour = 'param' or group = 'param'. colour argument
has an implied grouping. the line chart is geom_line

you can superimpose charts on top of each other with new arguments

note - ggsave = "filename" to save a chart.
