This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


##notes
if {TRUE} evaluates to true, i.e. empty if statement has value of its logical operator.
if {0} returns false because core property of R, 0 evals to false. 0 is the numeric version of false. It's a "falsey" value.

any number evals to true that isn't zero, but this is *generally* a bad way to write code

%% is "modulo" calculator. it's like division but JUST returns the remainder.
if x is a sequence or a vector, the if statement will evaluate only the 1st element

NOTE: if_else is the better function for assigning values to other values. If, by itself, is good for general forks in code, not for 
evaluating long vectors or dataframes one element at a time.

for case_when, order of conditions parses the problem of a value being evaluated meeting multiple conditions. So you don't need
them to be exclusive.
