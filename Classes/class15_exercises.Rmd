##Task Set 1: Non vectorised conditional
1. Correct the code below so that it runs.
```{r}
animal <- sample(c("Birds", "Fish"), size = 1)

if(animal == "Fish"){
    print("I can swim")
} else {
    print("I can't swim")
}
```
2. Modify the code above to check if an animal is a "Bird" and print whether it can fly or not.

```{r}
animal <- sample(c("Birds", "Fish"), size = 1)

if(animal == "Bird"){
    print("I can fly")
} else {
    print("I can't fly")
}
```


3. Use an `if()` with `any()` to print "yes" if there are `any()` values greater than 4 in the vector x below.
```{r}
x <- c(3, 6, 7, 8, NA)

if(any(x > 4)){
  print ("yes there are")
} else {
  print ("No")
}
```

4. Modify the code above to check if there any values that are missing in x. You can tell if an element in a vector is missing using the function `is.na()`.

```{r}
x <- c(3, 6, 7, 8, NA)

if(any(is.na(x))){
  print ("yes there are")
} else {
  print ("No")
}
```


5. Modify the code you wrote for task 3 to check if there are any values greater than 8 instead of checking if there are any missing values. This will likely throw an error. Can you reason why this might be giving you an error? See the documentation for `any()` to see how to address this.
#whoops didn't notice this

```{r}
x <- c(3, 6, 7, 8, NA)

if(any(x > 8, na.rm = T)){
  print ("yes there are")
} else {
  print ("No")
}

```
fixed with na.rm = T

6. Check if `all()` the values in vector x are not missing. If yes print "yes" else print "no".
#use !is.na, ! is symbol for "not"

```{r}
all(!is.na(x))

```


##Task Set 5: Vectorized Ifs
1. Use an `if_else()` statement to create a character vector that indicates whether a given value in vector x (from previous task set) is missing. It should be marked "missing" if a value is missing and "not missing" otherwise. 

```{r}
if_else(is.na(x), "missing", "not missing")
```



2. Load the gapminder and tidyverse packages

3. Use the `if_else()` in a `mutate()` to add a new column to the gapminder data that indicates whether the year is greater than 2000.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

gapminder %>% 
mutate(yearplus2000 = if_else(year > 2000,
       "it is great", "not great"))

```


```{r}
gapminder
```

4. Make sure you have already loaded the tidyverse and gapminder before you start this. Complete the code below (the `group_by()` and `if_else()`). For every year I would like to mark the `incomeGroup` variable as "Higher" if it is above the median `gdpPercap` for that year (global median) and "Lower" otherwise. The subsequent plot explores the relationship between `incomeGroup` and the `lifeExp`. How would you interpret it?
```{r, fig.width = 9}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroup = if_else(gdpPercap > median(gdpPercap))) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp, colour = incomeGroup)) +
    geom_boxplot(outlier.alpha = 0.3) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Over time life expectancy in high income countries have converged while those in low income countries have diverged", width = 70),
         y = "Life Expectancy",
         colour = "Income Group") +
    ggthemes::theme_tufte() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.x = element_blank()
    )
    
    
```

4. Complete the following code to create a new variable called incomeGroup that cuts the `gdpPercap` variable based on the median value of the `gdpPercap` every year. The final variable should have 4 levels - Low income, low middle income, middle income, high middle income and high income. I have complete one of the levels for you in the code. Complete the rest - gdpPercap < 0.75 x median(gdpPercap) is "Low middle income", gdpPercap < 2 x median(gdpPercap) is "Middle income", gdpPercap < 4 x median(gdpPercap) is "High middle income" and everything else is high income.
```{r, fig.width = 12}
gapminder %>% 
    group_by(year) %>% 
    mutate(incomeGroups = case_when(
        gdpPercap < 0.25 * median(gdpPercap) ~ "Low income",
        gdpPercap <  ~ "Low middle income",
         ~ "Middle income",
         ~ "High middle income",
        TRUE ~ "High Income"
    )) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = as.factor(year), y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    facet_wrap(~incomeGroups, nrow = 1) +
    labs(title = str_wrap("Over time life expectancy in high income countries have converged while those in low income countries have diverged", width = 90),
         y = "Life Expectancy",
         colour = "Income Group") +
    theme_tufte() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.title.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45)
    )
```


##Task Set 3: Write a for loop
1. Create a sequence of numbers from 1 to 50 store it in a variable

2. Write a for loop that returns "even" if a number in the vector you created above is even and "odd" otherwise. Store the results from this in a variable called odds_evens. You can initiate the `odds_evens` vector like this - `odds_evens <- vector("character", length = length(x))`. You can establish if a value is even by checking if the remainder when you divide it by 2 is zero. The syntax for this is `value %% 2 == 0`, where value is the number you are comparing.

3. Now do the same thing with an `if_else()` statement and store the results in a
