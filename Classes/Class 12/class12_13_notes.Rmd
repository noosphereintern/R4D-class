This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.



#notes.
when adding column numeric vectors of different length, the smaller vector is repeated to re-add into the larger vector.
it's not NA, and it's not decline to combine. X = c(1,2,3) + y = c(1:6) = 2,4,6,5,7,9

for equivalence checks, you do the same cycle. For prior set, x == y returns T T T F F F 

the sum command takes the literal sum of all numbers in the vector, and if you give it an x+y, it sums each number in both.

For sum (x + 2), the scalar operation goes first, i.e 2 is added to each value in x before all is summed. answer is 12.

for x %in% y, each value is checked individually.

when you filter for a column of character vectors, it checks only one of the vectors for each row, if its'a 2 row vector, it will miss half the many-> matches.

when you use filter X in y, you return a vector of size x, so when checking against a dataset, the big one you're checking inside should be x.
**you will get this wrong**

remember, when you summarize a grouped thing, output has one row per group. So don't use inside the sum to perform a numeric
operation on a column that's already groups. it will create a vector with many more values than the grouped table. 
The thing you're looking inside for matches can't be smaller than the key vector. This gives error : Column must be length 1,
(a summary value). If you do a mean(operation), that reduces the thing to one value per grouped row.

IMPORTANT: whenever you use a notebook, the WD is set to whatver folder the notebook is inside.

Don't recommend using the Rstudio UI to import datasets, it hides errors

in an r script you use: print(getwd) to see the current working directory.

##CLASS 14

Separate & Unite command: Convert  = T just allows R to apply conversion to the variable type instead of keeping it consistent.

The key to understanding gather is that it turns two columns of values into one column, but then makes a replacement 2nd column 
just marking which column each row came from.

separate and unite commands require you to use argument sep "" to define a character telling it when to stop putting the 
cell value into first col and start putting into 2nd, 3rd, 4th etc.

when you try to refer to columns whose names are numeric characters, you need backticks '34343' '321', or you will get error

Look at "R for data science" book is free online and very helpful!
