##GEneral Notes

Always ungroup after you group_by so you don't accidentally perform operations on an aggregate.
"levels" is a command that sets the order of factor columns. It's an argument of verb factor". It's also its own verb.
table" displays output of an atomic vector, counting each value in the column. Look this up later.
examples:
for ggplot histograms, binwidth and number of bins arguments should be used carefully, used together than can way overshoot the range of the data
mapping always equals aes, binwidth takes precedence over bins
in many cases, arguments are set implicitly
arguments go by order, so you don't have to declare the argument, i.e. type the name of the argument
basic structure is arg = input, but you often skip arg = and see function(input, input, input)
don't use pipes in ggplot, use plus signs
reorder command



This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
