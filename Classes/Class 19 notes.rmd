title: "R Notebook"
output: html_notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

##notes

So to remind with for loops. 

for i in dataframe
  print i
  
  will see and print the column
  
  for [[i]] in seq_along dataframe
    print [[i]]] will also work
    
    but for i in seq_along dataframe
    print i
    
    that will just print the column indices, not the column.
    
    Seq_along pulls indices - the number that describes the order of the column but [[]] counters that somehow
    
Map applies, in sequence, each element of the input data into a given function, one at a time

use list.files and list.dir, rather than using the UI

there's an excel_sheets function...

the name.repair argument to map lets you name a function that will clean names of cols
we're skipping rows to get the year columns and all below them (true data)

when we mapped the data, we got a list with one sheet per element
