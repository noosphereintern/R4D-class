##Recap on ggplot

```{r}
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13); library(gapminder); library(ggthemes)

flights %>% 
    group_by(hour, origin) %>% 
    summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = meanDelay, colour = origin)) +
    geom_line() +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Hour the flight took off",
         y = "Mean Departure delay for that hour",
         title = "Departure delay is greatest in the evenings") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.title = element_text(size = 34)
    )
