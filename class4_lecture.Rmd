##Learning Objectives
1. ~~Recap and learn the importance of ungrouping~~
2. Create and understand factor variables
3. Understand the need for visualizing data (without summarizing it) before analyzing it.
4. Create simple charts using the layered grammer of graphics
    + A barplot
    + A histogram
    + A column chart
    + A line chart
    + A scatter plot
5. Make facetted plots
6. Draw multiple geoms in one plot
7. Learn to make beautiful charts using
    + Aesthetics (alpha, colour etc.)
    + Scales
    + Theme
    + Labels and annotations
    + Extensions: ggthemes and others
8. Save a plot
8. Build a complex chart together


##Recap

The different dplyr verbs

1. arrange
2. filter
3. mutate
4. summarise
5. select
6. slice
7. group_by
6. pull

Lets select, filter, mutate, arrange in a single piped code chunk
```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)

flights %>% 
    select(1:3, contains("delay"), carrier, 7) %>% 
    filter(arr_time < 1200) %>% 
    mutate(newDate = paste(year, month, day, sep = "-")) %>% 
    arrange(desc(month))
    
```

Lets look at grouping and summarise
```{r}
flights %>% 
    group_by(month) %>% 
    summarise(meanArrDelay = mean(arr_delay, na.rm = T))
```

Anytime you group a tibble it is important to ungroup it to prevent unintended consequences.
```{r}
aGrpFlight <- flights %>% 
    group_by(origin)

glimpse(aGrpFlight)
```

For instance, if I am interested in finding the the flight that was most delayed in 2013, running the filter command on a grouped by origin tibble will yield three rows instead of the expected one. 
```{r}
aGrpFlight %>% 
    filter(dep_delay == max(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ungroup()
```

```{r}
flights %>% 
    filter(dep_delay == max(dep_delay, na.rm = T))
```

##Lets factor
Factor variables are the way in which R handles categorical variables
```{r}
genderVar <- sample(x = c("M", "F", "Other"), size = 200,  replace = T)

table(genderVar)
```

```{r}
fctGender <- factor(genderVar)

str(fctGender)
```

```{r}
table(fctGender)
```


```{r}
levels(fctGender) <- c("Other", "F", "M")
```


```{r}
table(fctGender)
```

```{r}
fctGenderFinal <- factor(genderVar, labels = c("Other", "F", "M"), levels = c("Other", "Female", "Male"))

table(fctGenderFinal)
```


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/Anscombe%27s_quartet_3.svg")
```


```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("../../Assets/anscombeSummary.png")
```



##Lets make some plots

Start with a basic histogram
```{r}
flights %>% 
    filter(dep_delay < 250) %>% 
    ggplot(data = ., mapping = aes(dep_delay)) +
    geom_histogram()
```
If I was coding regularly
```{r}
flights %>% 
    filter(dep_delay < 250) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(dep_delay)) +
    geom_histogram(bins = 150)
```


Lets look at a bar plot
```{r}
ggplot(data = flights, mapping = aes(carrier)) +
    geom_bar()
```

Lets make a column chart (regular world bar chart)
```{r}

flights %>% 
    group_by(carrier) %>% 
    summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = carrier, y = meanDelay)) +
    geom_col()

```
