**CHEATSHEETS**

1. [Data visualization](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-visualization-2.1.pdf)
2. [Data Manipulation](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/data-transformation.pdf)

**KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS**:

1. Assignment operator (<-) is `Alt+-` for Windows and `Option+-` for Mac
2. Insert new code chunk `Ctrl+Alt+I` for Windows and `Command+Option+I` for Mac
3. Run a line of code `Ctrl+Enter` for Windows and `Command+Enter` for Mac
4. Run all the code within a chunk `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` for Windows and `Command+Shift+Enter` for Mac
5. Insert a pipe operator (%>%) `Ctrl+Shift+M` for Windows and `Command+Shift+M` for Mac


##Task Set 1: Create simple charts
1. Create a histogram of arrival delay.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)
flights %>% 
group_by(arr_delay) %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., aes(arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram()

```


2. Run the following code to create a stacked column chart. Set the argument position for `geom_col()` to "dodge" to display these bars next to each other instead of on top of each other.
```{r}
flights %>% 
    group_by(origin, month) %>% 
    summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = meanDelay, fill = origin)) +
    geom_col(position = "dodge")
```
4. Create a scatter plot that compares arrival delay with departure delay. How would you describe the relationship between the two variables?
```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., mapping = aes(x = arr_delay, y = dep_delay), na.rm = T) +
  geom_point()
  #the data argument is optional here
```



5. Group the data by `day` to calculate the mean departure delay and pipe to a ggplot to create a line chart showing `day` on the x-axis and the mean departure delay on the y-axis. What questions come up when you look at this chart?


```{r}
flights %>% 
  str()
```


```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(day) %>% 
  summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day, y = meanDelay)) +
  geom_line()
 #can't call data = flights in the middle here, you have a new dataset
  
```



##Task Set 2: Facets and multiple geoms
1. Create a facetted version of the histogram you made in the previous task set. You can pick a facet of your choice (remember that a facet should be a categorical variable)

```{r}
#group_by(arr_delay) %>% 
 # ggplot(data = ., aes(arr_delay)) +
  #geom_histogram()

flights %>% 
  ggplot( aes(arr_delay)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~origin)
  
```


2. The code below is the same as task 3 in the previous task set. Modify it to create a facetted version of the chart (instead of the stacked bars). Think about what variable you should use to facet. 
```{r}
flights %>% 
    group_by(origin, month) %>% 
    summarise(meanDelay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = factor(month), y = meanDelay, fill = origin)) +
    geom_col() +
    facet_wrap( ~origin)
```

3. Extend the scatter plot you made in the previous section by adding a `geom_smooth()` to it.

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., mapping = aes(x = arr_delay, y = dep_delay), na.rm = T) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()
  
```


4. How would you make the line generated by `geom_smooth()` linear (i.e. a straight line)

```{r}
flights %>% 
  ggplot(data = ., mapping = aes(x = arr_delay, y = dep_delay), na.rm = T) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```




##Task Set 3: Make a pretty plot
1. Take any plot that you made in any of the previous set of tasks and
    + Add axis labels and chart title
    + Any additional aesthetics to make it prettier
    + Choose a theme template (either from ggthemes or from ggplot)
    + Make any additional changes you would like to make it more attractive
2. Save this plot using `ggsave()` as a png and share it on the class4 channel.
