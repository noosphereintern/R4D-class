NOTE - CODE ONLY WORKS INSIDE CODE CHUNKS
##GENERAL NOTES

Note- Global Environment button shows packages loaded
it's a subtab of the environment tab

```{r}
#install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("nycflights13")
library(tidyverse); library(nycflights13)

```


##SAMPLE CODE
```{r}
x <- c("a", "b", "c")
charVec <- x
numericVec <-  5:20
numSeq <- seq(from = 0, to = 30, by = 5)
logicalVec <- c(T, F, T, T, F)

```
3. Data structures THIS IS RECAP
```{r}
sampleList <- list(charVec, numericVec, numSeq, logicalVec)
length(sampleList)
```

flights
```{r}
flights
```

```{r}
class(mtcars)
```
 
```{r}
class(flights)
```
Note that when class gives multiple values, the thing 
has multiple classes. "flights" has all three listed classes.
PIPES. Just links the left side of the pipe (output of something)
to the right side of the pipe (input of something)
```{r}
flights %>%
  arrange(desc(dep_delay))
  arrange(., desc(dep_time))
```
arranges the data by the column name given as argument
desc here is descending
note that you need to describe what your'e arranging
unless you have a pipe. then it knows it's your last pipe.
the period syntax is where you'd put the input, as 1st argument


```{r}
newflights <- flights %>% 
  select(1, 2, 4, 6)
str(newflights)
flights %>% 
  select(c(1, 2, 3))
flights %>% 
  select(c(1, 2, 3, origin, dep_delay)) %>% 
  filter(month == 12 & day == 31 & origin == "JFK")
```

INSTRUCTIONS FOR GIT
Go into Github desktop, add a repository new local,










This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
