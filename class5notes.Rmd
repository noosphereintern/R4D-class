```{r, message = FALSE}
#gets rid of annoying chunk autooutput
genderVar <- sample(x = c("M", "F", "Other"), size = 200,  replace = T)

#we're sampling from the simple character vector named here, not calling anything


levels(fctGender) <- c("Other", "F", "M")
#this just renames the columns

fctGenderFinal <- factor(genderVar, labels = c("Other", "F", "M"), levels = c("Other", "Female", "Male"))
#here, levels reorders the columns and all assoc data

#get message = FALSE INFO

#facet_wrap(~origin)
#tilde is an operator along the lines of "is operating on" it associates variables with a function here
#you're telling it what to group by, facet is like a group. you need a categorical example to have this be useful.

#ggplot argument fill = month, argument in ggplot color change according to a unique param ("month")
#the first argument to geom_hisrogram is MAPPING, data is SECOND. reverse for ggplot itself.
#Error Mapping must be created by aes is an argument order error
#this only comes up with implicit assignments

# HOW TO SUBMIT ASSIGNMENT
Push
#Use settings to HOST part of my repo, a particular folder or file
#then you can make a URL out of the repo plus the html file name of your notebok
#the link is the url of your repo plus the file path, terminating
#in the notebook html file name

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
